# Pillars 2

Columns clone I wrote during covid lockdown.
Barely remember anything about it.

updated for ggez 0.7

I think there used to be sound but it seems to have stopped working.

## Controls
* left and right cursor keys move the pillar
* down cursor key fast drop
* Z and X to rotate the colors
